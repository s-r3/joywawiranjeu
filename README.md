# [Project 1:Data cleaning of Patient health records Recorsds project]
## Data Cleaning With Excel

This is a project i did as a begginner in data analysis
It mainly involved:

1. Removal of duplicates
2. Setting the date format  using the formular:IFerror(Text value(i2,DD/MM/YY),"") AFTER creting helper 'column J'
3. converting the data into a table for easy analysis in the pivot  table

this imge gives an overview of before data set cleaning

 The rfollowing image is after cleaning the data set

# [project2:Data querrying with SQL]
## Using MySQL to analyse Health_Patient data set

In this project , I loaded the resulting clean data to my Sql in a database named 'SPIKY'
I used various  data quering language functions and Data manipulation functions such as:

1. Select- begginer of each query
2. From
3. Where-conditional function
4. group by-Used after aggregate  functions such as count to mean columns
5. having- Mainly used after group by
6. order by - DESC AND ASC
As you can see examples below
[Example 1: aggregate, whaere , groupby, having]

# [Project 3:Using Pivot Tables To Analyse the cost of  Treatment as per gender]
## Used cleaned Health _Patient data set

The  project gave me hands on experience in using pivot tables for various formulaes
- Made it easier to use with aggregate functions sch as total sum and count
- Easy t0 remember formulars and apply  them directlty
- Easy to visualize using pivot tables

The image shows an example of a case used

# [Project 3:Using Powerbi to vsualize data and  Power Query to teansform Data}
## Calculated sum of the cost of each treatment and measured against gender and the treatment itself
This project gave me hands on experience on how to use power query to transform data from afolder as well as joining them
I calculated the sum of the cost  of treatment
Power bi offered various charts according to the data i had and also learnt how each is used

the following image shows an example
