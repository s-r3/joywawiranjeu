# [Project 1:Data cleaning of Patient health records Recorsds project]
## Data Cleaning With Excel

This is a project i did as a begginner in data analysis
It mainly involved:

1. Removal of duplicates
2. Setting the date format  using the formular:IFerror(Text value(i2,DD/MM/YY),"") AFTER creting helper 'column J'
3. converting the data into a table for easy analysis in the pivot  table

this imge gives an overview of before data set cleaning

# [project2:Data querrying with SQL]
## Using MySQL to analyse Health_Patient data set

In this project , I loaded the resulting clean data to my Sql in a database named 'SPIKY'
I used various  data quering language functions and Data manipulation functions such as:

1. Select- begginer of each query
2. From
3. Where-conditional function
4. group by-Used after aggregate  functions such as count to mean columns
5. having- Mainly used after group by
6. order by - DESC AND ASC
As you can see examples below
